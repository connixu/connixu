I am a MA student at Columbia University's Quantitative Research Methods in Social Sciences (QMSS) Program with an undergraduate background in business (marketing and accounting) and an interest in social science problems. Currently, I am working on a number of data analysis and visualization projects around topics of immigration, culture, gender, and education. I love beautiful and clever visualizations.
