I am a MA student at Columbia University's Quantitative Research Methods in Social Sciences (QMSS) Program with an undergraduate background in business (marketing and accounting) and an interest in social science problems around stratification. Currently, I am working on a number of data analysis and visualization projects around topics of immigration, culture, gender, and education. I love beautiful and clever visualizations. Feel free to contact me about my projects and my work anytime!
